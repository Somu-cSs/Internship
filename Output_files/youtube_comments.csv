RIP to all those Armored Core fans who passed away before they could witness this masterpiece ,8 months ago (edited),3.4K
"As a Titanfall fan, I had only ever heard of Armored Core in passing, until this trailer. This looks like everything I wanted from Titanfall. The future-military aesthetic, the inspiration from old anime, the grim undertones.",7 months ago,847
Fromsofts Art department is absolutely God-Tier.,7 months ago,709
i love how the most replayed part is the BRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTT,7 months ago,2.2K
"Armored Core 6's announcement has been a tremendous eye opener when it comes to the different generations of Fromsoft fans. Nothing wrong, mind you, I'm talking about the fans and not the haters. Just happy to see how big they've become that you can easily see the different era of fans they now have. You've got:",8 months ago,875
"Can't get enough of that launch sound at 2:21, paired with incredible OST. This is too epic.",8 months ago,464
"After all these years, the series which defined FROMSOFT. Its so good to be home bros.",8 months ago,3.7K
The way Fromsoft is able to make every frame of their trailers a painting is incredible!,5 months ago,120
Man the music sells how horrifying it is to live in a world like this. I used to be in awe of the armored cores. Now I fear them. And that's a good thing.  I'll carry that fear on the battlefield when I play this game. If anyone wonders where all the grim dark came from for all the souls games.  Look no further than here. This is where it all started.,8 months ago (edited),137
"How does FromSoftware keep doing this? Just classic after classic, other developers wish they could pull off these monolithic works of art.  Perfection",4 months ago,66
"While I know the game's actual graphics will not look as good as the CG in this trailer, I hope it captures the same level of scope and atmosphere. The gritty military realism blended with science fiction in the design aesthetic, the weight and heft of the machines, the ash-coated post-apocalyptic wasteland, that's the kind of dark futuristic feel I would love from a mecha game.",8 months ago,143
You know it’s a dope trailer when you watch it five times and you still want to watch it again lol. I hope this game is good.,8 months ago,198
Words cannot describe how long Armored Core fans have waited and dreamed for this moment.,8 months ago,8.8K
"I was introduced to FromSoft by Chromehounds. Then AC4A. After sadly missing AC5, I am beyond hyped to see 6 come at the perfect time. 

Miyazaki waited until the company was literally at the peak of the industry before dropping another Armored Core on everyone. He wants to make damn sure this franchise succeeds.",6 months ago,33
"Armored Core is what a game franchise should aspire to be. Consistency,  and improvement.  No fluff titles in the series. Every single game is a masterpiece imo. ",3 months ago (edited),29
"The music compliments this imagery so well. A devastated world that has been destroyed over and over again. The hopelessness and desperation as men wage war in cold machines, not only giving themselves a mask to hide behind their actions, but also allowing them to not feel remorse or see the enemy they are truly facing. Leaving no room for sympathy, it is just a war for survival.",7 months ago,60
"Glad to be back as a pilot once again
RIP to all those who didn't make it until now before they can join us again in this series.",6 months ago,48
"I can't get over the sound at 2:00. It actually sounds real and freaks the shit out of you like it should. If the sound quality in the game is anything similar to that, it will already be worth playing.",7 months ago (edited),73
"For anyone wondering, Miyazaki was director on the early stages of production, and the current director is the one behind Sekiro.
We're in for a damn great game.",8 months ago,3K
"I could not be happier about this. I was 8 when I first played an armored core game. And somehow my 8 year old brain loved it and loved building mechs and making them fight. Never realizing I’d fallen in love later with another from software game, Dark Souls. Only to find out a few years ago it’s the same developer.",8 months ago,42
Happy launch day everyone! Isn’t it great that 8 months ago we got this reveals and now we have the game? Wouldn’t it be great if all games did that…? ,7 days ago,4
"For years I've always wanted a good mech combat game, partly because mechs are just sick in general, and partly because I want plenty of customization to design my own mechs. I'm hoping this game delivers on the former.",4 months ago,14
This trailer is just perfectly done,4 months ago,16
2:06 the attention to detail in the arm is absolutely incredible,6 months ago,35
"No cringy narration, no annoying voice-over, just raw, spectacular imagery that speaks for itself. That's one heck of a reveal trailer!",8 months ago (edited),4.9K
"Everyone’s so diverse on the gameplay and how much the game’s changed compared to the older ones, but this is kind of the Armored Core I always wanted. I always felt like the missions were too short and that the game never gave the player enough freedom, but the way things look now, this is the game I’ personally always wanted to play and I pray that it turns out to be great",2 months ago,4
The sound director for this trailer deserves a promotion because it makes the hairs on my arms stand up every god damned time,1 month ago,8
Fromsoftware. You’ve made straight bangers for the longest time. Thank you for all your hard work and I wish you the best for the future,8 months ago,19
"Looking back at this trailer on my 3rd playthrough. Seeing the battle at the Wall, the Cataphract, and the PCA squad that hotdrops on you in chapter 3 is amazing",2 days ago,7
I have only known about Armored Core from the original Playstation way back in 1997. The garage music and customization back then was still amazing. It never ceased to amaze me that you could put tank treads on your mech. Its great to see a trailer for another entry.,5 months ago,10
"A glass raised for the Armored Core fans that couldn't be here with us to witness this moment. 

Our victories on the battlefield will be in your name.",8 months ago (edited),1.9K
"As a kid, I always wonder why Armored Core's Helicopter are so fkn huge and menacing. Seeing this now, they done made them even more huge and menacing. Probably one of the most dominant design for helicopters in gaming.",2 months ago,4
"No puedo parar de verlo, yo nunca he jugado antes un Armored Core, si lo habre visto alguna vez algun gameplay, pero este trailer, el OST, me eriza los pelos, me da una sensacion brutal, como te quiero FromSoftware, son los unicos a los que les reservo los juegos a ojos cerrados, la unica compañia que nunca me ha defraudado y se toma todo el tiempo que necesiten para sacar un juego completo, sin DLC ni microtransacciones.",7 months ago,9
"Best trailer of the entire game awards, sends shivers down my spine every time i watch it.",8 months ago,17
RIP to all those who didn't make it. For those who made it......we still have a job to do.,3 weeks ago,12
"I finished armored core 1 and am getting through project phantasma, jeez man this series was so ahead of it's time, the atmosphere, music, sounds, imo should be as iconic as ocarina of time. I'm so incredibly excited for what fromsoft is gonna do with this IP.",4 months ago,22
You know a game company is legendary when its logo creates immediate hype,8 months ago (edited),2.7K
Words simply cannot convey my anticipation! I have not been this stoked for a game in well over a decade.,5 months ago,11
01:48 that music hit was amazing.  I can't wait to hear this game as well as play it.,2 months ago,10
The opening shot of a solar flare or whatever it might be burning a planet looks so epic,5 months ago,11
Words can't describe how much I wanted this game to become reality. Armored Core was the first Mecha game I ever played and I was sad when it all but disappeared... and now its back.,8 months ago,10
"I've never played AC in my life ever, and I'm past 30 already, but going through these comments I get a pretty clear idea that this is a BIG deal to a lot of seasoned AC veterans. Salute to y'all who've apparently been waiting for too long, who've lost brothers who'd given up hope that one day, some day, the numbers VI would appear on a new trailer. Y'all held on, be it by hope or determination, and now finally, your time has come again!",8 months ago,18
"What I absolutely love about Armored Core..is how terrifying these machines are. In anime like Gundam or Macross, they say the mecha are built for war, however they still feel familiar. Like you look into the eyes of a Gundam and it still hold a trace of humanity to it. With the machines in Armored core, you can tell these things are meant for combat and destruction. The red in the camera, the conservative movements during battle, the steel grey coloring, it all comes together to paint that this machine can and will kill you. It’s so unnerving that you even question if someone is in there or if it’s just a hollow husk of a machine with one purpose in mind. I’m happy to see the franchise return after years traveling through poison swamps and fighting mystical Gods or awesome swordsmen.",8 months ago (edited),2.9K
"This trailer reminded me of the times when trailers were made very cinematographically, remember these trailers of Warcraft and other games, it was like you were starting to watch a cool movie. A very good trailer is my 9/10 to the creators of this beauty.",2 months ago,4
"Watched this trailer like 30 times since it came out & I still get goosebumps.
I can't wait!",7 months ago,8
"I've never played an Armored Core game but this trailer was absolutely magnificently made. Very cool piece of art by itself, game notwithstanding. It really hit a dry spot in a year of almost every trailer being ""fantasy game with bearded man with scars/strong tattooed woman lead"".",8 months ago,24
"Never played AC, but this Trailer is FIRE!",4 months ago,22
"First time I saw this I was glued to the screen. It’s lightning in a bottle, this trailer. Everything works together seamlessly. I wish I could better put into words what this makes me feel, not even really having played any of these games before.",1 month ago (edited),3
"only fromsoft have the balls to show something this beautiful without word or fluff, i just love the confidence in their game quality.",8 months ago,1.5K
"This is beautiful, what a masterpiece, a true legendary game back from the ashes of the dead",7 months ago,5
game was just as hype as the trailer its crazy how fromsoft always delivers,2 days ago,4
"I literally have not been more excited for a game since I was a little kid and Borderlands 2 got announced. This is everything I could have ever hoped for after Elden Ring, oh my god.",3 months ago,6
"I hope once this game comes out you'll be able to tell or there will be guides on how to build these cores in the trailer.
I love the design of both the tetrapod/quadroped as well as the the more sleek one with the face guard.",1 month ago,1
"1:40 Even decades later, the SPAS is futuristic enough to be wielded, by a mech no less",5 months ago,11
They've spent so long perfecting the look of dark fantasy that we almost forgot. These artists REALLY know how to draw technology.,8 months ago,389
"Never played an Armored Core game and probably never will, but I'm excited for you guys who are fans to finally be getting a new game. Have fun!",4 months ago (edited),10
"As someone who's been playing the game and completed it once, I can confirm everything shown in this trailer does exist in the final product (if there were any doubts).",2 weeks ago,2
"Looking back at this after beating the game, it would have been cool to get some of these cinematics in the game itself. The closest actual in-game moment would be Juggernauts appearance. Still, it's cool to see that basically everything shown in the trailer is in the game, safe for that first mech that's collecting parts. Really thought that one would have been a notable character given how it gets an entire scene",2 days ago (edited),2
"The feeling I get from this trailer and the game in general is, that Fromsoft got inspired by Terminator 2. From the moment the Coral exploded and consumed the surrounding area, looks and feels like Sarah Connor's dream sequence, in which the nuclear holocaust occurs due to Skynet overtaking. The music is straight from T2.",1 month ago,2
"The sound design here is just incredible, I keep replaying that shot with the machine gun because of how good it sounds. Everything feels so heavy and real.",8 months ago (edited),1.4K
"As a Last Raven connoisseur, I really miss Kawamori-sensei's mech designs... But, man, these mechs design looks so sick for today's standards !",8 months ago (edited),18
"Still love watching this trailer  even after playing the game, favorite part still is the mini gun firing at an unknown enemy at night with the whole area being light up by a rocket hitting the walls. with two mechs walking to their death.",4 days ago (edited),3
I've never played AC and have vaguely seen it on video game demo booths in stores like Gamestop or Target but this is fucking beautiful. Love how the mechs are behemoths walking the landscape wielding destructive capabilities. Glad the fans have something to look forward to.,7 months ago,3
I need this kinda game in my life now more than ever. Can't wait!,4 months ago,2
"I have been waiting years for this, playing random mecha games to scratch the itch armoured core left and having no real success. This is something I would gladly play full price to relive the joy I had playing this as a kid. I cannot use words to express the anticipation I'm feeling for this game to drop and can't wait to see if I can re-create the killing machine I made in the past.",7 months ago,4
There’s like 3 colors in this whole trailer and it looks absolutely glorious ,8 months ago,533
Am I the only one who is excited that it's bandai?  The model kits alone will be flipping awesome!!!!!   Imagine building the same mech that you have in the game!!!!,6 months ago,3
chord progression right at the end when it fades out is super nice,3 months ago,2
ショットガンを撃とうと安易に接近したACがパインバンカーでやられてるの好き,8 months ago,5
"My fellow Ravens and Lynxes...Our time has come. 


Armored core intro movies never miss. I really really hope this is good. My fam may not see me for a few days when this drops lol ",7 months ago (edited),8
"Judging from the trailer, it seems the parry blades/pile bunkers are now good in this game, I'm a blader in previous games except LR but it seems Parry blades will be fun and I can't wait to try it",8 months ago,4
"At this point, Armored Core is a straight up passion-project franchise for FromSoftware, and I'm SOOOOOO happy they're back at it.  I'm watching trailers from the event now, and this one by far has me the most excited... This franchise has a friggin cult following, and if you're in, you enjoy every single game they make haha!  Thanks for this guys!",8 months ago,647
"J'avais jouer au 1 et 2, j'avais fortement apprécié le coté personnalisation du mécha à volonté bipède, ou plus de jambes, sur chenille, propulsion, volant, arme légère moyenne lourdes tout influençait le gameplay et les stats. J'espère que cette nostalgie reviendra surtout avec nos attentes qui ne cessent d'augmenter",6 months ago,

"In a single day, From software just converted fantasy fans into a mecha fans",8 months ago,495
The old school synth vibes gave me chills,4 months ago,5
"One of the best series I have ever had the priviledge to enjoy. Fromsoft never holds itself back and seeing them breathe life back into one of their original IP's is just... Indescribable. The AC games always made me feel some sort of way and I am so excited, as a veteran Raven, to come back to it after all these years.",5 months ago,4
Let's make this game a success and hope EA realises they should've made Titanfall 3,4 months ago,5
"From (not pun intended) 2009 onwards, from software games are my favorite bar none. Always knew the Armored Core games but I have never tried or even purchased one in my 30 years of gaming experience. After the Fires of Rubicon reveal, I tracked down Armored Core For Answer and this gaming sin is going too be redeemed. I will be there day one my fellow Armored Core fans to celebrate together the return of this legendary series!",8 months ago,4
"Ver e ver de novo esse trailer, esse jogo promete",8 months ago,

Armored core always had the sickest trailers,4 months ago,4
"Thank you From Software 
25 years ago I asked my Grandmother to buy me the very first Armored Core because the pictures looked great, it became my favorite mech game ever and one of my most played on ps1, I still even listen to the OST sometimes. thinking of Armored Core will always bring me back to this time with a smile and good nostalgia.",8 months ago,549
This game is going to look beautiful I just know it. More than any other FromSoftware game.,6 months ago,1
"Damn I just can't stress enough how amazing this is...
The cinematography, the sounddesign, the worldbuilding...
Gives me insane old-school mecha anime vibes.",8 months ago,7

"I’ve never played any game of this franchise, but god this thing looks amazing! Can’t wait.",2 months ago,
This is like seeing your childhood friend that you haven't seen for awhile. This put a smile on my face. Can't wait to jump back in my AC!,8 months ago,512

"I remember playing armored Core 2 on the PS2 when I was a kid and getting like anything in that game that you had to beat the top Arena challenge, it was so much fun. I'm really looking forward to this. Fingers crossed.",7 months ago,1
"Played every Souls game, but never played an Armored Core game and never really been into the mecha genre. So I downloaded and started playing Armored Core 3, which apparently is considered the best in the series, and I'm having great time. Hell, I even started watching Neon Genesis Evangelion and the original 1979 Gundam series to get a better appreciation for the mecha genre.",8 months ago (edited),5

"Played Mechwarrior, played Armored Core, played Hawken, played Titanfall
I love how fromsoft hold the straight face while simultaneously presenting absurdly huge walking fortifications and tiny slim and beautiful ACs carrying arsenal twice or triple their size
This is the game that I've been hoping to see since I first played AC Last Raven on PSP in school",3 months ago,2
Never played armored core but that soundtrack is already gonna be amazing from what i heard in elden ring,8 months ago,15
"Elements of the AC's ive noticed: Primal Armor could be coming back. Dedicated energy Shields are coming back as well. Primal Armor Nuke-esq Explosions appears to be in as well (i forget what its officially called, but in AC4/4A you can deplete your Primal Armor to cause a massive explosion centered on your AC). To me, the AC4/4A combat style could very well be making a return, which i am VERY pumped for",8 months ago,
the art is absolutely visceral,4 months ago,6
Woah. Never played an Armored Core game in life but this trailer legitimately gave me goosebumps. I can only imagine how long time Armored Core fans feel when watching this. This is going to be something special.,8 months ago,300

"Can't wait for all the new people to experience Armor Core. If you love mechs, then you'll love this game.",8 months ago,4
My last mech games were the mech warrior series. Ofcourse it had to be From Software to bring me back in. I'm hyped for this.,4 months ago (edited),1
"What I love about this is that you can tell none of the fire is gone. It's still there, smoldering hotter than ever. For those who haven't experienced AC. It has a vibe like none other. I mean you can taste it in this reveal trailer. This is the soul of Armored CORE.",8 months ago,87
Armored core for answers is still one of my favorite games of all time I hope this one lives up to the legacy,8 months ago,1
I'm more excited for the soundtrack than anything else,8 months ago,6

Let's hope it truly launches this year!,4 months ago,1
"I'm really looking forward to this... keeps giving me Terminator and T2: Judgement Day vibes, Love it.",5 months ago,1
"I love the doomsday vibes this gives me. As a Gundam fanboy and growing up watching a lot of super robot shows, I never thought mecha could be so haunting and unsettling. But only from software could do something like that. Amazing.",8 months ago,769
I've been waiting for a new game in this series for a long time. My favorite game series.,8 months ago,
From Software did it again. They touched my fricking soul with this ...,8 months ago,4
"After ending the game, this trailer makes so much more sense.",3 days ago,4

This one is BY FAR the best one and now i am absolutely HYPED to try AC6!",8 months ago,1
can't wait to finally play this five years from now,6 months ago,2
From Software are the Ridley Scott or Stanley Kubrick of gaming.  Amazing peeps for sure.,3 months ago,2
Really curious to see how well From software is going to pull this off.,6 months ago,
"That shot at 2:21 where the visor locks at the face of the AC has that distinct animation movement you'd find in cinematics of recent Fromsoft games especially ER. Its similar to Malenia attaching her arm on the trailer.  the progession seems like:  Slow movement -----> Impact ------> Then subtle slow movement again.  as if instead of animating a subtle recoil/bouncing movement animation after the impact, they opted to for a  slow subtle movement  which makes the impact a bit weightless. I dont know why does it even bother me, I'm not even an animation expert I just find it quite funny. It is  probably the cinematic director's trademark. ",8 months ago,8
"I have not played AC, I couldn't remember if I played any AC back in my PS1 days but it looks really familiar (I played Lost Planet years later but it's no where near). I've replayed this trailer a lot of times, the heli's whirring and the machine gun firing sounds really fkn good.",7 months ago,
"Damn I like it. The visual design of mechs has become something real aesthetic. They now have some intimidating and cool looks, red visors/sensors/oculars. Looks badass.

Now we only need to see gameplay.",8 months ago,3
Never played Armored Core before but just from this trailer alone I'll be giving it a shot when it releases.,8 months ago,774
It’s really amazing how bladerunner which came out in like 1981 created this whole vibe that has been directly copied ever since countless times. Even now 40 years later anything sci fi needs to pay homage.,2 months ago,1

"The moment I can pre order this, I will be pre ordering 2 copies. I honestly had quit most gaming and now only play casual a few random multiple sessions with friends, but thats it, I thought I had grown out of the want to play single player games. I honestly thought there will never again be a game that gets me hyped. Then From Software released this trailer and damn they pull me back in",8 months ago,
"Wooooo! First time I've looked forward to a FROM game in -years-, this one I cannot wait for~",8 months ago,
I keep coming back to listen to the sound of that turret! ,6 months ago,1
I would totally watch this as a full length movie. Big props to whichever studio worked on this trailer for FromSoft.,6 months ago,1
0:47 and 1:56 these shots looked ASTOUNDING! The VFX artists did an incredible job on this trailer!,8 months ago,267
Sound design is just amazing. Oh my god.,7 months ago,2
Kinda like the glowing red eyes combined with the gun metal gray ACs and pitch black on those chopper things. It depicts them as absolutely demonic and something that should terrify you when you first see them.,3 months ago,8
damn i was not expecting the trailers to be so lore significant. i wonder if this was raven's last living fight.,3 days ago (edited),4
"Holy, as a massive Gundam fan and also a massive fromsoft fan i am very excited for this.",5 months ago,1
Many of my friends and I growing up played the original Armored Core games when they came out. Missed out on 3-5 but i'll be showing up to play 6 for sure.,8 months ago,
From Soft is simply so far ahead of the industry right now in terms of awe factor,8 months ago,434

"To a Raven who serves in other battlefields...

"I've only played Armored core For answer before and that's as years ago and I only played a little, this is one of the best trailers I've ever seen so I can't wait to give this a proper go this time.",13 days ago,1
the soundtrack alone sounds amazing,4 months ago,2
"This looks like a love letter to all the mecha anime fans from the 90s and those visuals! Straight up from the beginning of Akira. The synth music, the bleak setting... This is going to be the game that puts Armored Core in the place it deserve",8 months ago,76
Truth be told I came in around Dark Souls III and wasn’t around during this old era of FromSoftware - all I know is I just witnessed a giant robot wielding a SPAS-12 and I’m officially hyped out of my mind,7 months ago,6
"If the game has even a shred of the feel of this trailer, we're in for a great time. AC was never super cheery (hell, depending on your choices you get to kill 100+ million people in one of the games), but this trailer is the berserk equivalent of mecha combat. ",8 months ago (edited),2
"This feels like the announcement for monster hunter world to me. MHW was my first MH game. This will be my ""first"" AC game i buy. I remember AC from early psx demoes! 
Edit : i am not comparing both games. Just wanted to share my excitment for what surely will be an awesome masterpiece of a game! MHW was great and introduced me to the MH universe. Now the same may happen with the AC universe.can't wait ",8 months ago (edited),1
Finally a game that is worth getting a next gen console for.,5 months ago,1
Now we need something Armored Core but with flexibility & market-friendly as 30 Minute Missions model kits.,8 months ago,
3000 Hours in AC4A and this gave me goosebumps over my entire body.,8 months ago,14
This is a real treat for fans of this series and it's going to be an excellent ride for new fans fresh off Elden Ring. Fromsoft is goated for sure.,8 months ago,307
"As someone who has recently been playing through all of the numbered games (as well as a few of the spin offs, and also V has been difficult for a number of reasons mainly to do with its online focus), I can say that no game has me more hyped than AC6 right now. Can't really be overstated for those that might look at a trailer like this and say ""ah, but it's just cinematic, how much info can you really take from that"" - THE ACTION SHOWN HERE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF HOW THESE GAMES FEEL TO PLAY",6 months ago,6

I really hope they make this Armored Core closer to the For Answer style. Also have a high difficulty for the campaign because some of the older ones where too easy. Im a seasoned player but alot of these missions could have been better designed so you cant just ignore everything and just one shot the main enemy with a sword and gg.,8 months ago,

"Honestly... this looks incredible. The difference between these mechs vs your usual anime mechs are quite interesting cause these look like proper world ending, life ecosystem destruction machines in the most scariest ways. All I know is that all The Dark Souls games and Elden ring games really helped them capture the atmosphere of terror for these mechs compared to the past. VERY Well done.",7 months ago,

"The first ever game trailer I have watched atleast 20 times already and keep on watching everyday. Like holy smokes this shit is just insaneee. I'm not gonna sound like I am a armoured core fanboy or even played any of the games but my god does this trailer tick all the boxes for me.Dark metal, post apocalyptic, mechanical moving parts(as I am a mechanical engineer this shit just made me straight up hardddd), mechs with insane weaponry, mechs transforming, badass combat and just the overall feel is just outstanding man. This trailer gives me chills from head to toe. The music, oh my fuking god the music in this so sick. The helicopter scene and the scene where the mech dashes in was an icing on the cake. I don't care how the gameplay for this game looks like, I just wanna log into the game and watch the moving parts on the robots and customize them if I can. Everyone who has worked on this trailer and people who are working on this game, you all are doing god's work.",8 months ago,197
